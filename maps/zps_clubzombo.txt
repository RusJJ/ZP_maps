Storyline:
----------

The city is at a state of chaos as the riots are spreading, but we all know that this is something completely different.
The streets aren't safe anymore and the situation is just getting worse.

In the downtown district, the Clubzombo nightclub is still open. 
Perhaps you should move indoors for shelter before you continue your journey out of the city.

Murder on the dancefloor!
