Storyline:
----------

This small docks area was abandoned long ago. After your boat broke down, you've been stranded here.
The old generator is running now and you must Survive in the house until you are ready to move down river again.

It's quiet here, almost too quiet. I think something is moving in the water...

If you are living in constant danger on the run, it is hard to find the feeling of safety that only a loving home can give you.
This is your new home, fight for it!


Hints
-----
-If Zombies capture more Sideobjectives, they will gain new entrances to the house.
-Zombies will also access new Spawnpoints closer to the house.
-Lights will go out in the house if Zombies are capturing more points.
