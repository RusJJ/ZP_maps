Storyline:
----------

It has been 3 months since the city fell to the undead that now roam the empty streets.

The military has been broadcasting for the past 48 hours that they will make a final attempt to wipe out the threat infesting the area.
The bombraids will start soon, any survivors still alive in Shreddingfield must escape the city or seek refuge at a nearby bombshelter.

This is your final chance! Leave through the Supermarket, find some beans then hit the streets for further scavanging. Once you're set with supplies, head for the nearby shelter.

God speed!
