Description
-----------
Several months before the outbreak, an oil tanker ran aground off the coast of Iceland, becoming a safe haven for survivors. But now the infected have somehow made it onboard, and the survivors have to rely on their escape plan to make it to safety.

Objective:
-----------
1. Blow up the ship's own fuel tank in the bow via the pump room.
2. Destroy the electrical system to access the lower deck.
3. Set an C4 at the marker. Then, secure the zombie infested rooms.
4. Open the hatch system to escape to the lifeboats.
5. Get the password and then swim through the pipes then get in the lifeboats. 
6. Detonate the c4 if you make it to the island.
