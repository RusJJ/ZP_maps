Welcome to the government reserve task force.

You and your fellow squad members will be fully supplied through the mission you are about to execute.

During the first weeks of the outbreak aquatica helped us research bloodsamples from the undead. However we lost all contact with the station 7 hours ago.

Your mission is to get down there and investigate why the contact was lost and what they have researched.

Good luck.
